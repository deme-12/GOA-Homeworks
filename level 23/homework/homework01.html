        <i>The movie stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ben Kingsley as his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, and Ralph Fiennes as the brutal SS officer Amon Göth. It is known for its stark black-and-white cinematography, harrowing depiction of the Holocaust, and themes of humanity and redemption.</i>

        The film was a critical and commercial success, winning seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Spielberg, and remains one of the most powerful films about the Holocaust.
