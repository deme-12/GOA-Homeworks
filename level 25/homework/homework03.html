       <b><u> SpaceX</u></b> <b>(Space Exploration Technologies Corp.)</b> is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services <b>company founded by Elon Musk in 2002.</b> The  <br> company aims to reduce the cost of space travel and enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has become a leader in the space industry, known for its innovative technologies and ambitious goals. <br>

       <b>Key Achievements and Milestones:</b>
        Falcon 1: The first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit (2008).
        Falcon 9: A reusable rocket designed to lower the cost of spaceflight. The Falcon 9 made history by being the first orbital-class rocket to return to a landing site (2015).
        Dragon: A spacecraft designed to carry cargo (and later crew) to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX  Dragon  <br>capsule was the first private spacecraft to dock with the ISS (2012).
        <b>Starship:</b>  <b><u> A fully reusable spacecraft being developed to carry humans to Mars and beyond, with the goal of making space travel affordable and sustainable. </u></b>
        Starlink: A project to provide global high-speed internet access using a constellation of small satellites, aiming to improve connectivity worldwide, especially in remote areas.
