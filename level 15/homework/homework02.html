        <b>The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506 (with possible refinements continuing until 1517), is one of the most famous and iconic works of art in the world. It is a portrait of a woman believed to be Lisa Gherardini, a Florentine merchant's wife. The painting is celebrated for its masterful use of sfumato, a technique that creates a soft, gradual transition between colors and tones, and for the subject's enigmatic smile.
            The Mona Lisa is displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, where it draws millions of visitors annually. It is renowned for its mysterious allure and historical significance in the art world.
